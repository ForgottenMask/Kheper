# Kheper

Divinity reborn in a world of neon skies and flying ships.
Kheper is a story-driven action and investigation game where divinity is reborn in a society of steel and neon. You play as a God returned to mortal form, navigating a sprawling futuristic world of towering skylines, speeding hover-cars, and colossal flying ships.
As you uncover fragments of your past and wrestle with the weight of your divine purpose, you‚Äôll face powerful factions, unravel hidden conspiracies, and confront enemies who fear what your rebirth means for the future of humanity.
Play solo or with a friend in seamless co-op, combining fast-paced combat, environmental exploration, and mystery-driven investigation. Every choice carries meaning‚Äîshaping not only your destiny, but the fate of a society that may no longer need its go

The game combines fast-paced combat with investigative gameplay in both solo and co-op modes.
