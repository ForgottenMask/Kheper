Kheper is a story-driven action and investigation game where divinity is reborn in a society of steel and neon. You play as a God returned to mortal form, navigating a sprawling futuristic world of towering skylines, speeding hover-cars, and colossal flying ships.

Play solo or with a friend in seamless co-op, combining fast-paced combat, environmental exploration, and mystery-driven investigation. Every choice carries meaning—shaping not only your destiny, but the fate of a society that may no longer need its go
